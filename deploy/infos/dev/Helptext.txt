=== Ductility Class ===

AS/NZS 4671:2001 (Preface): The need to provide reinforcement with ductility appropriate to earthquake-resistant
concrete structures, coupled with recent investigations into the structural consequences of
the relatively low ductility of cold-worked reinforcement, has led to the introduction of
three ductility classes. These are distinguished in requirements by the letters ‘L’ (low), ‘N’
(normal) and ‘E’ (earthquake), placed immediately after the strength-grade number,
corresponding with different minimum values for uniform elongation and maximum stress
to yield stress ratio.

AS/NZS 4671:2001 (Foreword): 500E steels are unlikely to be used in Australia, it being considered that Australia's
generally low seismicity can be adequately accounted for by using Normal (N) class steels.

AS/NZS 4671:2001 (5.2): Shape is designated by the letters, R, D, or I, representing plain (Round), Deformed ribbed, or
deformed Indented, surfaces respectively.


AS/NZS 4671:2001 (5.3) Standard grades
The standard grades of reinforcing steels are 250N, 300E, 500L, 500N, 500E.
